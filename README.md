# Workday-Scheduler

This is an application using HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, and JQUERY that organizes your day! You can add comments to each hourly time slot from 9:00am until 5:00pm (normal work day hours) so you have your entire day organized. The time slots also change color depending on if the time is present, has passed, or is in the future.
